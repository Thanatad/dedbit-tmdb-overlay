# dedbit-tmdb-overlay
Personal, non-commercial project for learning purposes. A small Tampermonkey userscript that calls TMDb API to fetch movie/TV metadata (poster image and vote_average) and overlays them on a private tracker browse page on the client side. No server, no redistribution of TMDb data, no user tracking.
